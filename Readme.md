# Space learning
## Description
This project was born as a way to carry the astronomy to the youngest in a entertainment way. Futhermore the project is a new initiative for the TCU-535 from the Universidad de Costa Rica. The main tool to develop the game is the godot engine that can be find in the following link: https://godotengine.org/. As you can see in the license attached to the repository files, this is an open source project with the aim to keep in continuous development and improve.

## Usage
Inside the build folder there are builds for Windows and Linux, each one containing three files. A double click in the executable file is enough to open the game. There is no need for a installation due to is a portable game.

## Current develop stage
The player is capable to start a new game in the main menu as well as close the game. The higest score button have not been implemented yet. Catching coins and emeralds increse the score and emeralds also give a new tip to the player in the upper rigth corner to the player. New tips can be added to the phrases.txt file. 

## Future develop
The game is intendent to have a lifes system as well as a levels system. The originall idea is that each level presents information about the one planet from the solar system so the first level have a Mercury thematic, the second level a Venus tematic and so on. Also new enemies with new patterns should appear for each level according to each one thematic. Another thing to keep an eye on is the posible to export the game to mobile platforms like smart phones and tablets. Godot offers easy ways to implement this new features due to its flexibility. Evenmore, a new menu should be designed in order to implement some of this new features, even the high score button.
